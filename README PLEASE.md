# Photon-Plant-Danger-Detector
This program accepts a baseline temperature-brightness when you push the button. Then signals to you with LED's as conditions change

Hit the button to set a baseline (Blue LED will flash as confirmation).
The red LED will grow brighter as the temp changes, reaching 100% at 2* differences
The yellow LED will light when the brightness is half or less than the baseline.

This would be great for monitoring plants or animals if you put the photon in a nice housing.
It can easily be updated in the future to use a better alert system than LED's, like text messages.
